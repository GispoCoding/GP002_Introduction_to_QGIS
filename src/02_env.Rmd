QGIS is a free open-source desktop GIS that can be easily installed on Linux, Windows, and Mac.
You can use QGIS as a WMS/WFS client to see how the different services provided by GS work.
Download and install the latest version of QGIS at [qgis.org](https://qgis.org).

GDAL and OGR are libraries that provide useful tools for processing raster and vector spatial data, respectively.
The easiest way to install GDAL/OGR on Windows is to simply install QGIS.
A standard QGIS installation should also install the OSGeo4W Shell.
Opening the OSGeo4W shell from the Start menu brings up a new terminal window where GDAL and OGR commands are available to be used.
